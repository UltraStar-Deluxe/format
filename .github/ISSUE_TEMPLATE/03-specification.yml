        ### Guidelines f√ºr Specification Changes

        When proposing general changes to the specification, please respect the following guidelines:

        - Be specific: Suggest a concrete change to the specification.
          General topics and opinions are much better discussed on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tNEXZw2QJX).
          If possible you can include the suggested wording in your suggestion.
        - One thing at a time: Restrict your suggestion to a single thing.
          Do not include multiple independent changes in a single issue.
        - Be actionable: We want to bring each suggested change to a clear decision whether it should be implemented or not.
          If there are more than 3 paths how a change can be implemented, it can be hard to reach a consensus.

        By making speciifc, actionable suggestions that focus on one thing you can help the community to reach better decisions.
        If you are unsure, don't hesitate to ask in the `song-format` channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/tNEXZw2QJX).
